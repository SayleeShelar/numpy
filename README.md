# NumPy Examples

This repository contains examples of using NumPy, a powerful numerical computing library for Python. NumPy provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Getting Started

To run these examples, you need to have Python and NumPy installed on your system. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Once NumPy is installed, you can run the examples in a Jupyter notebook or any Python environment. Simply copy the code snippets into your editor or Jupyter notebook and execute them.
